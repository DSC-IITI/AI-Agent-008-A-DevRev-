1,"Quantum superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics where a quantum system can exist in multiple states at once. When measured, the system collapses into one of the possible states. This concept is pivotal to quantum computing, enabling qubits to represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, unlike classical bits."
2,"Wave-particle duality highlights the dual nature of quantum entities, exhibiting both wave-like and particle-like behaviors. Electrons and photons, for instance, display interference patterns in experiments like the double-slit, affirming their wave-like properties. However, they also behave like particles during detection."
